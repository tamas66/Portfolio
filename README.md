# Hobby Projects Repository

Welcome to my Hobby Projects Repository! This repository serves as a collection of personal projects that I have developed to explore various aspects of data science, machine learning, finance, and sentiment analysis. The projects are organized by their functionality and the field of study they pertain to. Below, you will find a brief overview of each project, along with instructions for running and contributing to them.
